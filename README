The json-schema-enforcer is a library and utility that generates JSON
parsers that adhere to JSON schema specifications. Both parser source
code (bison, flex, C++) and dynamically loadable compiled libraries
with C and C++ APIs can be generated. Other language bindings will be
added in the future.

The supported JSON schema validation rules that are supported can be
found here:

    http://json-schema.org/

For example, the following JSON object is a schema specification for
a JSON array whose first element, if present, must be an integer, and
all subsequent array elements, if any, must be date strings complying
with the "full-date" specification in RFC 3339.

{
  "type": "array",
  "items": [
    {
        "type": "number"
    }
  ],
  "additionalItems": {
    "type": "string",
    "format": "date"
  }
}

This JSON object complies with the JSON schema above:

[
    5.4,
    "2018-05-06",
    "2018-04-30"
]

json-schema-enforcer takes a schema specificaition, validates it, and
then generates a parser that enforces the schema validation rules and
C++ classes that encapuslate JSON objects matching the specification.
The genreated parser source code is written in bison, flex, and C++.
The generated code can be automatically compiled into a library that
can be dynamically loaded by programs, allowing for on-the-fly code
generation and parsing without having to rebuild your project for
each new schema.
